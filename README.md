<h1>Twitter User Corpus</h1>

<b>Date completed:</b> June 22, 2023 

<h2>Description</h2>
This project used R to analyse the top 15 most frequent words (excluding stop words) found in Kennedy McMann's tweets.

<h2>Remarks</h2>

- Words need to be lemmatised deal with words such as "it's" and "i'm".
- Update 2024: Unfortunately, since Twitter API is no longer free (thanks a lot Elon), I am unable to carry out these changes.
